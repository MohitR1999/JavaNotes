#### Magic Number
- The first four bytes of the class file is magic number. This is a predefined value used by JVM to identify .class file is generated by valid compiler or not
- The value should be ```0xCAFEBABE```
- Whenever we are executing a java class, if JVM is unable to find valid magic number, then we will get runtime exception saying ```java.lang.ClassFormatError : Incompatible magic value```
#### Minor and Major version
- Major and minor versions represent .class file version
- JVM will use these versions to identify which version of compiler generates the current .class file
	- v1.5 -> 49.0
	- v1.6 -> 50.0
	- v1.7 -> 51.0
	- v1.8 -> 52.0
- Lower version compiler generated .class files can be run by higher version JVM, but higher version compiler generated .class files can't be run by lower version JVM. If we try to run, we will get runtime exception saying ```java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError```
	- javac v1.6 => Java v1.7 (No problem)
	- javac v1.7 => Java v1.6 (Exception is raised)
