- For every JVM, one heap area is available
- Heap area will be created at the time of JVM startup
- Objects and corresponding instance variables will be stored in the heap area
- Every array in java is object, hence arrays will also be stored in the heap area
- Heap area can be accessed by multiple threads and hence the data stored in the heap memory is not thread safe
- Heap area need not be contiguous
