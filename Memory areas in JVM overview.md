- Whenever JVM loads and runs a java program, it needs memory to store several things like bytecode, objects, variables etc.
- Total JVM memory is organised into the following 5 categories
	- Method area [[Method area]]
	- Heap area [[Heap area]]
	- Stack area [[Stack Memory]]
	- PC registers [[Program Counter (PC) registers]]
	- Native method stacks [[Native method stacks]]
- Method area, heap area, and stack area are considered as important memory areas with respect to programmer
- Method area and heap area are per JVM whereas stack area, PC registers and native method stack are per thread
- Static variables will be stored in method area
- Instance variables will be stored in heap area
- Local variables will be stored in stack area
